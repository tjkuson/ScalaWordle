# Wordle in Scala

This is Wordle written in Scala 3.

Its main purpose is to demonstrate Scala 3 and functional programming for beginners to either. Feel free to open an issue or pull request if you have any suggestions.

## Game features

- Ask for a guess until the word is guessed, the user quits, or the game is over
- Check if the guess is in the word list
- Print the result of the guess

## Language features

Programming Wordle is a good way to demonstrate core language features of Scala 3 and functional programming.

For example,

- [x] [Collection methods](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/book/collections-methods.html)
- [x] [Pattern matching](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/pattern-matching.html)
- [x] [Higher-order functions](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/book/fun-hofs.html)

Note: this project uses Scala 3 and is not compatible with Scala 2. At this level, the main difference is the syntax (code now reads more like Python and Ruby). For more information, see [New in Scala 3](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/new-in-scala3.html).
